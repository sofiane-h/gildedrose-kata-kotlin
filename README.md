# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This project is my solution of the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata. 
I have made it in Kotlin, this is why I just cloned the original [GitHub project](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) and only keep the kotlin files and tests related stuff.

## Requirements
See [Gilded Rose Requirements Specification](GildedRoseRequirements.md) file for more information.

## Getting Started
TBD

## Usage
